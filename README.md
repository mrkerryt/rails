# Rails (Working Title)

This is a work in progress puzzle game written in Javascript ES6 using the Phaser game library.

## Origin Story

30 years ago my father invented a puzzle game similar to a Rubiks cube.  The objective of the game was to sort a collection of coins into a pattern by sliding two rails.

He made a prototype from metal, perspex and some old copper pennies.  It weighed a metric tonne!

This project is a surprise Christmas present for my Dad.  I am going to create a web and mobile version of the puzzle and then publish it to itch.io, and the Apple/Android stores.

###Work Done
I've committed the initial source code to Github, this includes the main gameplay mechanics and a couple of test levels.  

Another large piece of work included in the first commit worth mentioning is the scaling of the game when played on different screen sizes.  I still need to investigate how it will look on actual physical devices once you take into account screen DPIs but I think the scaling is there.

###Todo List
I am now working on the supporting screens that make this feel like a game such as level instructions, options and transitions between these screens.

I will then add some more levels and try to make it 'fun'.  I'm planning an achievement system, and If I have time I'd like to add a character animation version of my dad who reacts to the player's actions.


The last big technical challenge will be configuring Webpack/Cordova and Ionic to create the App versions.
